======================

-  clean up code formatting in the DOOM code

-  more robust VPO_LIB code -- ideally have no I_Error() calls

-  get sector height as if from a player (32x32 bbox)
   - test all lines which intersect bbox
   - generate a blockmap for faster testing

WISH:  multi-threaded processing  [ very difficult ]
