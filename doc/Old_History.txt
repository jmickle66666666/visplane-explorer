      VPO ZOOM: TODO addition.

 1666 Andrew Apted	2012-05-24
      VPO_ZOOM: process empty(ish) tiles faster than fuller ones, so that
      when scrolling or zooming out the fresh areas can catch up.

 1665 Andrew Apted	2012-05-23
      VPO_ZOOM: created a TODO.txt -- goals for future versions.

 1664 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      VPO_ZOOM: version bump to 0.80

 1663 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: improved screen_x/y calc in RenderOneTile(), fixing
      the occasional pixel gap between a row or column of tiles.

 1662 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      VPO_ZOOM: remove canvas tiles when a new WAD or map is loaded.

 1661 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      VPO_ZOOM: tweaked background (VOID) color and openings hue.

 1660 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      VPO_MAIN: no longer disable load buttons, since loading a new wad
      should work now.

 1659 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      VPO-LIB: added check to VPO_OpenMap() that a wad file is loaded.
      Removed the trailing \n from SetError() messages.  Misc tidying.

 1658 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      VPO-LIB: added P_FreeLevelData() function to properly free the arrays
      loaded by P_SetupLevel().  Use this in VPO_CloseMap().  Choosing a
      different map in the main program should work now [without any memory
      leaks either].

 1657 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      VPO-LIB: simplified WAD API, have a W_LoadLump() function which just
      returns the lump loaded into memory [no caching semantics], and a
      W_FreeLump() to free that memory block.
      
      Added a W_RemoveFile() which closes the added wad file and frees
      the lumpinfo array.  Use this for VPO_FreeWAD() function.  Now it
      should be possible to load a different wad from the main program.

 1656 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      VPO_ZOOM: added Main_TryLoadWAD() and Main_TrySetMap() functions.
      Implemented loading the wad giving on the command line: drag'n'drop
      should work now.  When a wad only has a single map, automatically
      load it.

 1655 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      tweak

 1654 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      comment tweaks.

 1653 Andrew Apted	2012-05-22
      VPO_ZOOM: made overflow colors ramp up from bright red to a dim pink
      (same hue as the overflow pink, but a lower intensity).
      Changed openings palette to use bright yellow as the hue.

 1652 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: when loading a wad, check that it contains at least one map.

 1651 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO-LIB: implemented the VPO_GetMapName() API function.

 1650 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO-LIB: added code to w_wad.cc to find map header lumps, such as MAP01
      or E1M1 (though it is not limited to those patterns since it checks the
      lump names after the potential header lump).

 1649 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: BIG FIX! checking all eight angles got broke (in the API change
      probably), and it was only testing a single angle (8 times, heh).

 1648 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      tweak.

 1647 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: version bump --> 0.71

 1646 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: use a simpler palette for the visplanes (the browny one),
      and rearranged the colors for the other ones (grayscale for openings).
      Renamed heat_palette --> visplane_palette.

 1645 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: fixed the off-by-one problem when encoding and decoding a datum_t
      (valid values need a +1 to distinguish them from DATUM_UNSET).

 1644 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM | panel: moved 'openings' to bottom of view choice, since it
      is the least useful thing to look at (rarely comes close to overflow).

 1643 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: implemented different palettes for the drawsegs, openings,
      and solidseg views.

 1642 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: implemented keys to change the view mode: 'v' for visplanes,
      'd' for drawsegs, 'o' for openings and 's' for solidsegs.

 1641 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: some bug fixing and improves to 'Count' display, in particular
      we show the limit too (e.g. "32 / 128") and append "OVF" when the value
      is greater than the limit.

 1640 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: converted Tile class to use datum_t (not byte) for the data.

 1639 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: added logic to set the 'Count' widget properly, with a '+' on
      the end when the value was too high to store, and "(Overflow)" added
      when the value is overflowing the game's limit for that value.

 1638 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: support for rendering other things, DrawSegs and Openings (etc).
      Also partial support for showing those things in the 'Count' widget.

 1637 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: tweaked DATUM_VOID and DATUM_OVERFLOW values (all bytes are
      the same), and added DATUM_CLOSED for closed (or narrow) sectors.

 1636 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: make initial window size smaller (fit on 640x480 screen).

 1635 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_MAIN: updated Main_TestSpot() to use the new VPO_TestSpot() API
      which retrieves four values (visplanes, drawsegs, openings, etc).
      It also now packs the four values into the new datum_t type.
      
      Also added limit_of_XXX global vars to hold the actual visplane (etc)
      limits for the current game -- so far hard-coded to DOOM values.

 1634 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO_ZOOM: define the datum_t type, some special values like DATUM_VOID,
      and some macros to pull apart the fields.

 1633 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO-LIB: forget to remove 'what' from VPO_TestSpot() API -- done.

 1632 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO-LIB: changed the API for VPO_TestSpot() function, it now requires
      four pointer arguments to update the counts for visplanes, drawsegs,
      openings and solidsegs.
      
      Also changed 'dz' semantics, negative values will be offset from the
      sector ceiling height (instead of always producing RESULT_BAD_Z).

 1631 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO-LIB | render: renamed total_solidsegs --> max_solidsegs, and now it
      records the maximum # of solidsegs needed during rendering.

 1630 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO-LIB: increased MAXVISPLANES to 512, increased MAXOPENINGS too.

 1629 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO-LIB: use 'overflow_exception' for all exceptions, removed the hacky
      #defines for visplane_overflow_ex (etc..)

 1628 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO-LIB: added check for solidseg overflow, keep track of number in new
      'total_solidsegs' global var, and increased limit from 32 --> 128.

 1627 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO-LIB: fixed X_SectorForPoint() to be more compatible with DOOM,
      using R_PointInSubsector() to find the sector.

 1626 Andrew Apted	2012-05-21
      VPO-LIB: prevent a crash due to floorplane or ceilingplane being NULL
      (this occurred in MAP28 of 10SECTOR.wad at x=-2304 y=-4352).

 1625 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO_ZOOM: we were not testing all 8 angles (only 4) -- fixed.

 1624 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO_ZOOM: version bump.

 1623 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO-LIB: got the overflow exceptions working and tested.  Ended up
      using only a single exception.

 1622 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      tweak.

 1621 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO-LIB: added check for opening overflow.  [already did drawseg overflow]

 1620 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO-LIB: added three exceptions which will be thrown on overflows,
      one each for visplanes, drawsegs and openings.  Added total_openings
      and total_drawsegs globals.  Added code to throw the visplane and
      opening overflow exception [not done drawsegs yet].

 1619 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO_ZOOM: disabled the old testing code to load a wad/map, also don't
      busy wait with Fl::wait(0) when no map has been loaded.

 1618 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO_ZOOM | menu: fixed bug in 'Choose Map' callback, plus we convert the
      map name to uppercase and truncate at 8 letters, and GoHome() on success.

 1617 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO_ZOOM | menu: implemented the 'Load WAD' and 'Set Map' buttons.

 1616 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO_ZOOM: allow zooming in further, up to 1:1 scale (100%).

 1615 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: implement scrolling, done by the same MakeTiles() code
      where we try to find an existing tile for each base_x/y location.  That
      is rather simplistic, but it works!

 1614 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      VPO_ZOOM: added a "Press TAB to toggle map" hint in settings panel.

 1613 Andrew Apted	2012-05-20
      tweak

 1612 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: merged MakeTiles_ZOOM() into MakeTiles() -- pass a
      'reuse_old' parameter.  Remember the bounding box of tiles (in map units).

 1611 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: made the "F1" key bring up the ABOUT dialog.

 1610 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: implemented scrolling via the cursor keys.

 1609 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: implemented '+' and '-' keys for zooming.

 1608 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: removed selbox stuff (not needed).

 1607 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: have a HandleKey() method for keyboard stuff.
      Implemented the "HOME" key (it also resets the zoom).
      Tidied up various code (e.g. event handler).

 1606 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | menu: implemented the 'Quit' button.

 1605 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: dead code removal

 1604 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: menu tweak.

 1603 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: implemented MakeTiles_ZOOM() which can reuse the
      already computed data to stock the new tiles (as much as possible).
      
      It also needed to align the base_x/y of the tiles to a "tile grid"
      boundary (64 * zoom, map units), which means that the copied values
      when zooming in are placed in the _even_ rows and columns, allowing
      the interlacing code to show them correctly.

 1602 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | tiles: fixed a bug in CopyData() with row/column align check,
      and made the bbox check a bit more lax.

 1601 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | tiles: implemented a 'CopyData' method which can copy data
      from an old tile which has a different zoom and base_x/y coords.
      This allows keeping a lot of the data when zooming in or out.

 1600 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: delete tiles in destructor.

 1599 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: keep a list of free tiles, utility methods NewTile(),
      FreeTile() and FreeAllTiles().

 1598 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: implemented 'Count' display on info bar (query datum at mouse
      pointer from the tiles).

 1597 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      tweak

 1596 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | about box: added spaces to get some alignment.

 1595 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: version bump.

 1594 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: implemented the 'About' button / dialog.

 1593 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: split UI_Menu code into its own files (not ui_panel.cc/h)

 1592 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: dead code removal.

 1591 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: redraw the rendering canvas every second.

 1590 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: fixed the heat_palette[] which was off-by-one (zero is the
      "unset" color, 1..limit is the real range).
      Changed VOID color to a dark gray.

 1589 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: use the new heat_palette[] for rendering tiles.

 1588 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: tweaked heat_colors[]

 1587 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: code to create a "heat palette", interpolating a small set of
      colors to make a nice gradient, and handle the special PIXEL_* values too.

 1586 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: fixed vertical alignment of rendered tiles (before
      they were 64 units too low in the window).

 1585 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM: simplified Main_TestSpot() to always check 8 angles, and
      removed the heights_to_check[] array since we always check VIEWHEIGHT +
      MAXBOB.
      
      Made the special datum values PIXEL_VOID and PIXEL_OVERFLOW use the top
      of the range (254 and 255, respectively).

 1584 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO-LIB: actually return number of visplanes.

 1583 Andrew Apted	2012-05-19
      VPO_ZOOM | tiles: fixed bugs in ButterflyCoord().

 1582 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: proper logic to read pixels from a Tile and draw
      them, using a small RGB buffer.

 1581 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: preliminary work on rendering the tiles (drawing them solid
      with random colors at the moment).

 1580 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: added logic to create an array of tiles for the
      current window (MakeTiles), and logic to process tiles in a round-robin
      way (ProcessOneTile).

 1579 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | tiles: implemented a "complete" flag.

 1578 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: initial implementation of Main_TestSpot().

 1577 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: partial work on a Main_TestSpot() function which will return
      values compatible with the Tile code.

 1576 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | tiles: implemented the Process() method, in particular the
      PictNextDatum() logic which creates the "butterfly" style sequence of
      coordinates to try.  Removed the rawGet() and rawSet() methods.
      The Allocate() method now does a Clear().

 1575 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | tiles: implemented readNearest().

 1574 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | tiles: added skeletal implementation of methods.

 1573 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: created the interface for new 'Tile' class, which is responsible
      for managing a 64x64 block of visplane (etc) data.

 1572 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: added widgets for the 'Settings' panel : view, angles and heights.

 1571 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: zoom-in limit increased to 2 (was 1).

 1570 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: tweaked colors for backgrounds of panels and infobar.

 1569 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: zoom-out limit lowered to 64 (from 128).

 1568 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: global var 'new_color_scheme' controls the color scheme.

 1567 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: split UI_Panel into two widgets, new one called 'UI_Menu' and
      and contains the main buttons.

 1566 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      tweak.

 1565 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: added new (empty) code files: m_tiles.cc/h and m_util.cc/h

 1564 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO-LIB: quieten a compiler warning.

 1563 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: implemented displaying the Scale on the infobar.

 1562 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: added Vis() check to DrawLinedefs().

 1561 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: implemented GoHome() method to center the canvas at
      the center of the map.  Added MoveOrigin() utility method, which will
      be needed in the future for updating the tile cache.

 1560 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: implemented showing the mouse location (in map units).

 1559 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: actually use the UI_InfoBar in the window.

 1558 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: fix DrawGrid() to handle canvas at other positions.

 1557 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: new code files 'ui_infobar.cc/h' -- for an information bar
      sitting at the bottom of the main window.

 1556 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: draw plain lines instead of "knobbly" ones.

 1555 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: fixed zoom logic to zoom around the mouse pointer
      (rather than just zooming around the middle of the canvas).

 1554 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: initial code for zooming...

 1553 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: fixed grid not to draw too many points at high zooms
      (which slows down scrolling a lot).  Settled on '32' as the default zoom.

 1552 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | canvas: replaced 'Scale' field with integer 'zoom' field
      which represents how large each on-screen pixel is (in map units).

 1551 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: test code to load a map for display.

 1550 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: rewrote DrawLinedefs() canvas method using the VPO-LIB API,
      with a new global 'map_is_loaded' to ensure a map has been loaded.

 1548 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: tweaked minimum window size.

 1547 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: updated image test stuff for VPO-LIB API changes.

 1546 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM | Makefile.unix: added 'halfclean' target, leaves the vpo_lib
      objects in place.

 1545 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO-LIB: implemented VPO_GetLinedef() and stubbed out VPO_GetMapName().

 1544 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO-LIB: updated existing code for API changes, e.g. split VPO_LoadMap()
      into the separate VPO_LoadWAD() and VPO_OpenMap() functions.
      Also updated the simple test program for the API changes.

 1543 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO-LIB: API tweaks

 1542 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO-LIB: updated API (not code) with separate functions to load a wad
      and to open a map.  Added 'what' parameter to VPO_TestSpot() for ability
      to test drawseg and opening overflows too (in the future).  Added a
      function to retrieve map names, and another to retrieve linedefs from
      the current map (for drawing).

 1541 Andrew Apted	2012-05-18
      VPO_ZOOM: set a maximum canvas size (rather arbitrary, 1600x1200).

 1540 Andrew Apted	2012-05-17
      VPO_ZOOM | Makefiles: renamed EXEs to official name: Visplane Explorer

 1539 Andrew Apted	2012-05-17
      VPO-LIB: temp stuff to allow compiling.

 1538 Andrew Apted	2012-05-17
      VPO_ZOOM | Canvas: only the X and Y axes get drawn thick now (not every
      grid_step_3 units).  Changed orig_x and orig_y to double instead of int,
      which should fix scrolling stickiness/jerkiness at large zooms.  Got
      the scrolling code (Mouse button 3) working again.

 1537 Andrew Apted	2012-05-17
      VPO_ZOOM: got the grid drawing working again.

 1536 Andrew Apted	2012-05-17
      VPO_ZOOM: smaller default window size, played with which side to put
      the panel on -- going with the right side.

 1535 Andrew Apted	2012-05-17
      tweak

 1534 Andrew Apted	2012-05-17
      VPO_ZOOM | Makefiles: fixed missing FLTK libs from $LIBS

 1533 Andrew Apted	2012-05-17
      VPO_ZOOM: fixed bug in ui_panel.cc -- did not create mouse_y properly.

 1532 Andrew Apted	2012-05-17
      VPO_ZOOM: created a proper (but basic) main program which opens the FLTK
      window and runs the widgets.
