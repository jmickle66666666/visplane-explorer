COMPILING (Linux)
=================

Dependencies:

1. GNU C++ compiler and associated tools
   packages: g++ binutils

2. GNU make
   package: make

3. FLTK 1.3 
   website: http://www.fltk.org/
   package: libfltk1.3-dev

   You may also need: libxft-dev
                      libxinerama-dev
                      libjpeg-dev
                      zlib1g-dev

4. XDG Utils
   (only needed for Linux, to install the desktop and icon files)
   package: xdg-utils


Assuming all those dependencies are met, then the following shell
command will build the visplane-explorer binary.
(The '>' is just the prompt)

   > make


Some systems may need additional CFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS in order
to find the required libraries (especially FLTK).  For example,
the following is reported to work for Gentoo Linux:

   CFLAGS  += -I/usr/include/fltk-1
   LDFLAGS += -L/usr/lib64/fltk-1/


INSTALLATION
============

First make sure the binary was compiled successfully.

Then become root (via the 'sudo' or 'su' command) and enter the
following shell command:

   > make install

That will install the visplane-explorer binary, the man page,
and the desktop and icon files.


COMPILING (Windows)
===================

This is done in Linux using a cross-compiler ("mingw-w64" package).
Makefile.xming is the makefile for this, and it assumes there is a
cross-compiled FLTK in the directory (or symlink) 'fltk_win32'.

Sorry, but if you want to compile the Win32 binary under Windows
itself then you are on your own.
